Images
######

A disk Image is a template used to create virtual disks and quickly bootstrap ready-to-use virtual servers. A disk image usually contains a pre-installed operating system and a set of post-installation scripts, which are responsible for an automated configuration of the operating system, services and applications.

:ref:`Access Permissions <acl>`
--------------------------------- ----------------
*SuperAdmin*                      read-write
*DCAdmin*                         read-only
*ImageAdmin*                      read-write (DC-bound images only, limited by :ref:`DC image settings <dc_image_settings>`)

.. note:: In the upper right corner is a button labeled ``Show All``, which can be used to display all images, including images that are not associated with the current working virtual data center.

.. seealso:: When creating virtual servers from disk images, it is possible and often required to :ref:`assign parameters (metadata) to virtual servers <metadata>`, which can be used by a virtual server for its configuration during server's initial start or other purposes.


Image Parameters
================

* **Name** - Unique image identifier (usually used in the :ref:`API <api>`).
* **Alias** - User-defined name of an image (usually displayed in the :ref:`GUI <gui>`).
* **Version** - Image version.
* **Access** - Image visibility. One of:

    * *Public* - Image is usable by all users in this virtual data center.
    * *Private* - Image is usable by *SuperAdmins* and owners of this image.
    * *Deleted* - Image is hidden and unusable for new servers, but can be still used by some already defined servers.
* **Owner** - Image owner.
* **DC-bound?** - Whether a disk image is bound to a specific virtual data center.
* **Size** - Minimal virtual disk size required by a disk image (read-only).
* **OS Type** - Operating system type (read-only). One of:

    * *Linux VM*
    * *Windows VM*
    * *BSD VM*
    * *SunOS VM*
    * *SunOS Zone*
    * *Linux Zone*
* **Status** - Current state of a disk image (read-only). One of:

    * *ok* - Image is ready to use.
    * *pending* - Image is being created, updated or deleted.
* **Resizable? (Resize)** - Specifies whether an image is able to resize a virtual disk during an initial start or deploy procedure. This is usually achieved by a post-installation script that has to be included in the disk image.
* **Shutdown after deploy? (Deploy)** - Specifies whether an image is able to shut down a virtual server after an initial start. Such an image should include a post-installation script, which will shut down the running operating system after it has been successfully configured. After a virtual server is stopped, it is considered to be successfully deployed, and it will be automatically started by the system.
* **Description**


Managing an Image
=================

A disk image can be created, updated or deleted by a *SuperAdmin* or by a *ImageAdmin* (DC-bound image only). A disk image can be created from a snapshot of a virtual server or can be imported from a remote location. The import operation can be performed only by a *SuperAdmin* or a *DCAdmin* user with *ImageAdmin* **and** *ImageImportAdmin* permissions. An image used by at least one virtual machine cannot be deleted. However, its *Access* attribute can be changed to *Deleted*, thus the image will be hidden and unusable for new virtual servers.

.. note:: Management of server images is related to the :ref:`VMS_IMAGE_VM <dc_image_settings>` global setting. With no image server configured all operations will be performed at database level only.

.. seealso:: Creating an image from a server snapshot is thoroughly explained in a :ref:`separate chapter <image_create>` dedicated to virtual server :ref:`snapshots <snapshot>`.

Advanced Image Settings
-----------------------

* **Tags** - Comma-separated list of image tags, which will be inherited by virtual servers that will use this image.


Attaching an Image
==================

Used for associating an existing disk image with a virtual data center. This operation can be performed only by a *SuperAdmin*.

.. note:: A disk image can be only used when attached to a virtual data center.


Detaching an Image
==================

In order to remove an association of a disk image with a virtual data center, the image must not be used by any virtual machine within the virtual data center. This can be performed only by a *SuperAdmin*.


Importing and Image
===================

A disk image can be imported from a remote location. The import operation can be performed only by a *SuperAdmin* or a *DCAdmin* user with *ImageAdmin* **and** *ImageImportAdmin* permissions. An image manifest URL (with `IMGAPI <https://images.joyent.com/docs/>`__ metadata about the image) is required for the import operation.

Image Repositories
------------------

A disk Image Repository (a.k.a. ImageStore) is a remote server location with :ref:`disk images <images>` available for download. It has to implement the `IMGAPI <https://images.joyent.com/docs/>`__ endpoints for listing and downloading image manifests and files. Disk image repositories can be configured by modifying the :ref:`VMS_IMAGE_REPOSITORIES <dc_image_settings>` global setting. After the image repository is properly configured and loaded, one can browse through all available images and import them onto the internal image server.

If a global image server (:ref:`VMS_IMAGE_VM <dc_image_settings>`) is configured in the system, the image repository list will automatically include a local repository named after the image server. This functionality is available only to a *SuperAdmin* and can be used to import manually created images (i.e. images converted from other virtualization platforms), which were placed onto the image server by hand.
