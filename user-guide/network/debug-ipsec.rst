.. _debug_ipsec:

Overlays and IPSec Troubleshooting
**********************************

One disadvantage of overlay networking is that it considerably increases the complexity of the whole system. This consequently increases the number of places where things can go wrong.

If an overlay network does not work, the best way to start debugging is to to connect using SSH to compute nodes that host virtual machines that refuse to communicate. Then you can use several tools to find out what's going on.

    - ``ipadm show-addr`` - this command will list all configured IP addresses and respective NICs on a compute node (hypervisor). You need to find out which interface is used for overlay communication. The decision is simple: if the compute nodes are in the same :ref:`physical datacenter <cn_install_datacenter>`, they use the admin interface. Otherwise they use the external interface. Find the appropriate interface name by looking at configured IP addresses.

    - ``ping`` of overlay IPs - try to ping the other compute node's `adminoverlay_0` IP address

    - ``snoop`` - a network sniffer. Your swiss army knife to find out what packets are (not) flowing between the compute nodes in question. Example: for sniffing packets on the external interface between two nodes, run this (203.0.113.110 is a public address of the compute node on the other side):

        .. code-block:: bash

            [root@node02 (MYDC-remote1) ~] snoop -rd external0 host 203.0.113.110

    - ``ping`` inside the virtual machines - try to generate some traffic inside overlay network to see some packets by *snoop*.

    - ``/opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_*`` directory - contains various IPSec debug scripts (see :ref:`here<debug_ipsec_scripts>`).

How things should look like when using *snoop*:

* Overlay communication without IPSec, using UDP port 4790:

    .. code-block:: bash

        10.xx.yy.10 -> 10.xx.yy.11   UDP D=4790 S=49251 LEN=118
        10.xx.yy.11 -> 10.xx.yy.10   UDP D=4790 S=49251 LEN=118
        10.xx.yy.11 -> 10.xx.yy.10   UDP D=4790 S=49177 LEN=94
        10.xx.yy.10 -> 10.xx.yy.11   UDP D=4790 S=49251 LEN=118
        10.xx.yy.11 -> 10.xx.yy.10   UDP D=4790 S=49251 LEN=118
        10.xx.yy.10 -> 10.xx.yy.11   UDP D=4790 S=49252 LEN=62

.. _ipsec_negotiation_example:

* Initial IPSec negotiation (UDP port 500):

    .. code-block:: bash

         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=232
         xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=160
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=372
         xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=300
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=100
         xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  UDP D=500 S=500 LEN=205

.. _ipsec_communication_example:

* Normal IPSec communication (ESP protocol):

    .. code-block:: bash

        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15027
        xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0xfdc85734 Replay=86306
        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15028
        xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0xfdc85734 Replay=86307
        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15029
        xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0xfdc85734 Replay=86308
        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15030
        xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0xfdc85734 Replay=86309
        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15031
        xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x11a183ba Replay=15032

* IPSec fragmented packets (bad thing, you need to lower the MTU in the overlay rule definition):

    .. code-block:: bash

         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12388 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12388 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12389 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12389 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0x83c78776 Replay=30625
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12390 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12390 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12391 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12391 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12392 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12392 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP SPI=0x7fc7028d Replay=207382
         xx.yy.zz.20 -> xx.yy.zz.10  ESP SPI=0x83c78776 Replay=30626
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12394 Offset=0    MF=1 TOS=0x0 TTL=60
         xx.yy.zz.10 -> xx.yy.zz.20  ESP IP fragment ID=12394 Offset=1480 MF=0 TOS=0x0 TTL=60


When IPSec things are working correctly, you should see an :ref:`IPSec negotiation packets<ipsec_negotiation_example>` when virtual machines start to communicate for the first time (or a key renegotiation is needed). Immediately after that, you should see a normal :ref:`IPSec communication<ipsec_communication_example>`.

What can go wrong:
    * `You don't see any IPSec packets` - verify the snoop interface and parameters or verify that IPsec services are online (``svcs ipsecalgs ike policy``).
    * `You see only the negotiation phase packets from one IP but no packets from the other IP` - verify firewall, :ref:`verify IPsec config<ipsec_esdc_overlay_cmd_update>`, try to :ref:`flush the association database<ipsec_sadb>` on both hosts.
    * `You see only the negotiation phase packets from both IPs but no normal IPSec ESP packets` - verify :ref:`IPsec config<ipsec_esdc_overlay_cmd_update>`, try to :ref:`flush the association database<ipsec_sadb>` on both hosts.
    * `You see normal IPSec ESP packets but only from one host` - try to look at :ref:`dropped packets<ipsec_print_dropped_packets>` and :ref:`flush the association database<ipsec_sadb>`.
    * `You see normal IPSec ESP packets from both hosts but the VMs don't communicate anyway` - try to use network sniffer inside virtual machines on both nodes. There's a suspicion that one node is accepting packets but the other node is dropping them. If the suspicion is true, you should see the incoming and outgoing packets inside the one virtual machine but only outgoing packets inside the second virtual machine. Also look if the :ref:`ipsec_print_dropped_packets.d<ipsec_print_dropped_packets>` will show some output. To solve the problem try to :ref:`flush the association database<ipsec_sadb>` or verify the :ref:`IPSec policy<ipsec_services>`.

The following IPSec debug scripts can save you a lot of debugging time. They are ordered by priority in which you should go when searching for the answer.

.. _debug_ipsec_scripts:

IPSec debug scripts
===================

.. _ipsec_print_dropped_packets:

Print packets dropped by IPSec
------------------------------

To discover if IPSec is dropping any packets, you can use very handy dtrace script ``/opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_print_dropped_packets.d``. It will tell you detailed info about the dropped packet including the reason why it was dropped.

    .. code-block:: bash
        :caption: Sample output from ipsec_print_dropped_packets.d

        IPsec dropped an inbound IPv4 packet.
        IPPROTO: 17    (1=ICMP, 6=TCP, 17=UDP; 50=ESP, see netinet/in.h)
        Src IP address: 203.0.113.242
        Dst IP address: 203.0.113.241
        Src port: 52678
        Dst port: 4789
        Packet len: 156
        Dropped by: IPsec SADB

There are several reasons for packet to be dropped:

    * **IPsec ESP** - the receiving host knows nothing about the sender. The most probable reason is that the receiver was restarted or has flushed its security association database and the sending host did not reach the key renew timeout. You can wait a few minutes or :ref:`clear the association database<ipsec_sadb>` on the sender (to start renegotiation).
    * **IPsec SPD** - no matching IPSec security policy was found. Either the packet is forged or the security policy rules are incorrect.
    * **IPsec SADB** - no corresponding entry was found for the received packet. There are multiple reasons for this, e.g. corrupted packet or misconfigured policy.


Turn on IPSec debug
-------------------

To make the things simpler, you can enable IPSec debug by running ``ipsec_logging_enable.sh`` and watching the logs: 

    .. code-block:: bash

        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] /opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_logging_enable.sh
        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] tail -f /var/adm/messages /var/log/in.iked.log

To turn the logging off, run ``/opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_logging_disable.sh``.


.. _ipsec_esdc_overlay_cmd_update:

Run esdc-overlay update
-----------------------

To verify and (if needed) re-apply the configuration of IPSec (and overlays) on all compute nodes, you can run ``esdc-overlay update`` on the first compute node. For more info see :ref:`here<esdc_overlay_cmd_update>`.

.. _ipsec_sadb:

Inspect/Flush IPSec SADB
------------------------

To see current contents of a security association database on a compute node, run ``/opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_associations_print.sh``. The output is quite detailed but you can see the IPSec status of all connected hosts there. Please note that the other side does not necessarily have the same association status resulting in dropped packets. In this case it's worth examining the SADB also on the other compute node.

If you want to force a full renegotiation of IPSec connection, run

    .. code-block:: bash

        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] /opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_associations_flush.sh

To flush all SADBs on all compute nodes, you can use Ansible to make the things simpler:

    .. code-block:: bash

        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] esdc-overlay update-ans-hosts
        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] cd /opt/erigones/ans
        # test ansible connect
        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] ansible all -a date
        # flush all SADBs everywhere
        [root@node01 (myDC) ~] ansible all -a /opt/erigones/bin/debug/ipsec_associations_flush.sh

.. _ipsec_services:

IPSec services and config files
-------------------------------

There are 3 system services and 3 configuration files. To see the status of IPSec services, run ``svcs ipsecalgs ike policy``.
Effective configuration files are located here:

    - ``/etc/inet/ike/config``
    - ``/etc/inet/secret/ike.preshared``
    - ``/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf``

But because *SmartOS* does not persist the configuration by default (when booted from an USB stick), you can find the persistent configuration files here: ``/opt/custom/etc/ipsec/``. After changing the persistent configuration, reload IPSec by running ``/opt/custom/etc/rc-pre-network.d/020-ipsec-restore.sh refresh``.
